## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript 

### What I learned

I used CSS flex property to align my website. Basic HTML properties. In the javascript section I used async function to fetch the data from data.json file and used it to mark the bar graphs correctly. To be specific I used forEach js function to get each elements from the data.json file and then manipulated css using DOM.

### Continued development

I still need to understand async, promises and fetch(). I have to know concepts in detail of the specified things.
